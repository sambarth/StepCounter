Cole Petersen:
    Cole was a helpful participant in our peer programming meetings where we laid
    the foundations of the application, and created at least stubs for all the
    functions we'd end up having in our final build.  During these peer programming
    sessions, Cole participated as a `back-seat' programmer, looking up relevant
    documentation while I acted as the scribe to write the code.

Scott Hoefer:
    Scott was also an active participant in our peer programming meetings.  Like Cole,
    Scott's role was a `back-seat' programmer.  I was please to work with Scott as it
    seemed that whenever I'd run out of ideas, he'd have an idea to try.

Team:
    Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts during the weekend of Sept. 16-17, only
    I was able to access the application build, and am thus the only one able to make
    traces.
